Specific
========

This is a web app called "`Specific`."

`Specific` is best described as "a programming paradigm."

It can also be described as "fun, silly, and a way for me to not go crazy from programming all day."

That "me" up there is a person named "Aaron Melocik."

He wrote this app.

It could further be described as "a language that compiles into Javascript, like Coffeescript. It is designed explicitly to read and write like English, enforcing very minimal demands on the actual words used to write the code. It will work by demanding that the meaning of all statements is unambiguous and specific. It will compile accurately because it will be designed around a robust, intelligent, and constantly-evolving dictionary of phrases that correlate English-language phrases into functional Javascript. When there are conflicts, it will ideally query the user in something as close to English as possible in order to resolve the ambiguity. It is designed with the fundamental philosophy that the English language is a perfectly adequate mechanism to convey every scrap of meaning to a machine that ECMAscript can. It will never compromise, though it is likely to be very opinionated.

"This repo is a collection of programs written in Specific. Feel free to contribute. The language will be shaped around a collection of 'working' programs. In fact, this README is the furst one! This is functional Specific code!"

(`Specific` is finished.)
